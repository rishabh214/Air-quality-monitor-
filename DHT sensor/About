I have used DHT11 sensor to measure Temperature and Humidity
Installing the listed libraries can help in shortening of code.
  1. Adafruit Unified sensor by Adafruit (this library can be installed from "include libraries" menu in arduinoIDE)  
  2. DHT sensor master library (it has to be installed manually.)
