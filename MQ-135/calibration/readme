This is a analog sensor meaning it will output analog value. analog sensors need to be calibrated in order to ensure correct
results.
To calibrate this sensor we will run sensor in clean air for around 30 minutes.
this will help us calculate R0 value. see RS/R0 graph in datasheet for detailed explaination.
